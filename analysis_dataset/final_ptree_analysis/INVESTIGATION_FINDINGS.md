# P-Tree 100% Win Rate - Root Cause Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

---

## üî¥ The Problem

P-Tree analysis on Swedish stock data produces **impossible results**:
- **100% win rate** over 25 years (311 out of 311 months positive)
- Factor returns: **4.2% to 16.2% EVERY MONTH**
- Sharpe ratio: **~13** (vs. S&P 500: ~0.4)
- No negative months, even during 2008 financial crisis

---

## üî¨ Investigation Process

### 1. Source Code Analysis ‚úÖ

**Finding:** `fit$ft` represents actual portfolio returns

From `/PTree-2501/PTree/src/PTreeModel.cpp` line 665:
```cpp
ft = all_leaf_portfolio * leaf_weight;
```

This is: **weighted sum of leaf portfolio returns** ‚Üí should be able to go negative!

### 2. Data Quality Check ‚úÖ

**Swedish data (`ptree_ready_data_full.csv`):**
- Total observations: 95,518
- Excess returns (`xret`):
  - Mean: 1.39% (plausible)
  - Range: -99% to +992%
  - **Positive: 50.9%, Negative: 47.0%** ‚Üê Normal!
- Monthly aggregates: **196 positive, 115 negative** ‚Üê Normal!

**Conclusion:** Raw data is fine.

### 3. Characteristics Analysis üî¥

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**

Checked correlation between characteristics and returns for January 2011:

```
Correlation with xret:
  rank_me:      -0.2762
  rank_bm:       0.0364
  rank_mom12m:   0.0753
  rank_mom1m:    0.7392  ‚Üê ‚ö†Ô∏è SMOKING GUN!
  rank_beta:     0.1647
```

**`rank_mom1m` has 0.74 correlation with current month returns!**

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE: Look-Ahead Bias

### The Bug

**File:** `analysis_dataset/ptree_attempt2/scripts/1_prepare_data_relaxed.py`
**Line 70:**
```python
characteristic_mapping = {
    ...
    'return_1m': 'rank_mom1m',  # ‚Üê THE BUG!
    ...
}
```

### What `return_1m` Actually Is

**File:** `analysis_dataset/scripts/3_build_final_dataset.py`
**Line 147:**
```python
out['return_1m'] = out.groupby('isin')['price'].pct_change()
```

This calculates: **return from month t-1 to month t**

### The Problem

```
Month t:
  - return_1m = (price_t - price_t-1) / price_t-1  ‚Üê Calculated using price_t
  - xret = return at month t                        ‚Üê Same month!

We're using return_1m (which includes month t data)
to predict xret (month t return)

This is PERFECT LOOK-AHEAD BIAS!
```

### Why P-Tree Gets 100% Win Rate

1. P-Tree splits on `rank_mom1m` (the current month's return rank)
2. Stocks with high `rank_mom1m` are stocks that **already went up this month**
3. P-Tree creates a portfolio of "stocks that went up" ‚Üí portfolio return is positive
4. Result: **Every month is positive** because we're selecting winners **after the fact**

## üìä Evidence

### Attempt 1 (Strict NA)
- Factors only 2011-2022 (data quality issue)
- Win rate: 100%
- Factor range: 5-16%

### Attempt 2 (Relaxed NA)
- Full period 1997-2022 ‚úÖ
- Win rate: 100% ‚ùå
- Factor range: 4-9% ‚ùå

**Both attempts have the same bug:** Using `return_1m` as a characteristic.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Option 1: Remove `return_1m` (Recommended)

**Edit:** `ptree_attempt2/scripts/1_prepare_data_relaxed.py`

**Remove line 70:**
```python
characteristic_mapping = {
    'market_cap': 'rank_me',
    'book_to_market': 'rank_bm',
    'momentum_12m': 'rank_mom12m',
    # 'return_1m': 'rank_mom1m',  ‚Üê DELETE THIS LINE
    'volatility_12m': 'rank_beta',
    ...
}
```

This leaves us with **18 characteristics instead of 19**.

### Option 2: Lag `return_1m` Properly

**Edit:** `scripts/3_build_final_dataset.py`

**Change line 147:**
```python
# OLD (WRONG):
out['return_1m'] = out.groupby('isin')['price'].pct_change()

# NEW (CORRECT):
out['return_1m'] = out.groupby('isin')['price'].pct_change().shift(1)
```

This makes `return_1m` at month `t` represent the return from `t-2` to `t-1`, which is a valid lagged momentum characteristic.

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Implement Fix** (Choose Option 1 or 2)

2. **Re-run Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   # If using Option 1 (just remove from mapping)
   python analysis_dataset/ptree_attempt2/scripts/1_prepare_data_relaxed.py
   Rscript analysis_dataset/ptree_attempt2/scripts/2_run_ptree_attempt2.R

   # If using Option 2 (rebuild entire dataset)
   python analysis_dataset/scripts/3_build_final_dataset.py
   python analysis_dataset/ptree_attempt2/scripts/1_prepare_data_relaxed.py
   Rscript analysis_dataset/ptree_attempt2/scripts/2_run_ptree_attempt2.R
   ```

3. **Expected Results After Fix:**
   - Factors should have **both positive AND negative** values
   - Win rate: **~55-65%** (realistic)
   - Sharpe ratio: **~0.5-2.0** (realistic for factor strategies)
   - Performance should degrade during 2008 crisis

4. **Validate:**
   - Check factor correlation with market return
   - Compare Sharpe ratio with benchmarks (Fama-French ~0.4)
   - Verify no month has suspiciously high returns

---

## üìö Key Learnings

1. **Always lag characteristics:** Features at time `t` should only use data up to `t-1`
2. **Check correlations:** High correlation between characteristic and target ‚Üí red flag
3. **Sanity check results:** 100% win rate over 25 years = something is wrong
4. **Look-ahead bias is subtle:** Using month-over-month change can include current period data

## ‚úÖ FIX IMPLEMENTED & VALIDATED

**Date Fixed:** 2025-10-05
**Implementation:** Option 2 (properly lagged return_1m)

### Changes Made

1. **`scripts/3_build_final_dataset.py` (lines 147-154):**
   - Created `current_return` for target variable (ret/xret)
